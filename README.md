## 1. Business Problem

## 1.1 Problem Description

Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks,Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is best place for foodies. The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such an high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. 

1.	serial: The index/serial number
2.	URL : The URL for the restaurant 
3.	address:  The address of the restaurant.
4.	name: The name of the restaurant.
5.	online_order: Does the restaurant allow online order(Yes/No)
6.	book_table: Does the restaurant allow table booking(Yes/No)
7.	rate: Restaurant rating out of 5.
8.	votes: The number of votes for the restaurant.
9.	Phone: Resyaurant contact number
10.	Location: Location of the restaurant
11.	rest_type:Type of the restaurant(Casual Dining, Café etc.).
12.	dish_liked: The Most liked dishes in the restaurant(Pasta, Lunch Buffet, Masala Papad etc.)


## 1.2 Problem Statement

To build a regression model to predict the cost of restaurant for two people based on the given indicators in the training data. 

## 1.3 Real world/Business Objectives

We need to predict price based on different parameters like Average_cost for two people, Online Order available, foods,menu list, most liked dishes etc features.

## 1.4 Machine Learning Formulation
Here we suppose to predicted rating of restaurant, so it is basically **Regression** problem.

## 1.5 Perfomance Metric
We will try to reduce Mean Square Error ie **MSE** as minimum as possible. So it is **Regression** problem reducing **MSE**.

## 2. Data Acquire:

## 2.2 Data Validation 
In this step, we perform different sets of validation on the given set of training files.  
1.	 Name Validation- We validate the name of the files based on the given name in the schema file. We have created a regex pattern as per the name given in the schema file to use for validation. After validating the pattern in the name, we check for the length of date in the file name as well as the length of time in the file name. If all the values are as per requirement, we move such files to "Good_Data_Folder" else we move such files to "Bad_Data_Folder."

2.	 Number of Columns - We validate the number of columns present in the files, and if it doesn't match with the value given in the schema file, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder."


3.	 Name of Columns - The name of the columns is validated and should be the same as given in the schema file. If not, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".

4.	 The datatype of columns - The datatype of columns is given in the schema file. This is validated when we insert the files into Database. If the datatype is wrong, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".


5.	Null values in columns - If any of the columns in a file have all the values as NULL or missing, we discard such a file and move it to "Bad_Data_Folder".

## Data Insertion in Database
1) Database Creation and connection - Create a database with the given name passed. If the database is already created, open the connection to the database. 
2) Table creation in the database - Table with name - "Good_Data", is created in the database for inserting the files in the "Good_Data_Folder" based on given column names and datatype in the schema file. If the table is already present, then the new table is not created and new files are inserted in the already present table as we want training to be done on new as well as old training files.     
3) Insertion of files in the table - All the files in the "Good_Data_Folder" are inserted in the above-created table. If any file has invalid data type in any of the columns, the file is not loaded in the table and is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".

## Prediction
1) Data Export from Db - The data in the stored database is exported as a CSV file to be used for prediction.
2) Data Preprocessing   
   a) Drop columns not useful for training the model. Such columns were selected while doing the EDA.
   b) Replace the invalid values with numpy “nan” so remove them.
   d) Scale the training data.
   e) convert categorical to numerical 
3) Clustering - KMeans model created during training is loaded, and clusters for the preprocessed prediction data is predicted.
4) Prediction - Based on the cluster number, the respective model is loaded and is used to predict the data for that cluster.
5) Once the prediction is made for all the clusters, the predictions along with the original names before label encoder are saved in a CSV file at a given location and the location is returned to the client.


## Deployment
-We will be deploying the model to the Pivotal Web Services Platform. 

-This is a workflow diagram for the prediction of using the trained model.
